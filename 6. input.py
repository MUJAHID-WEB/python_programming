# Input:

input('What is your name? ')

# for more readability use 'variables'

first_number = input('What is your first number? ') # 50
last_number = input('What is your last number? ') # 30

print(first_number)
print(last_number)

# for addition

result = first_number + last_number
print(result) # output will be string '5030' and show as concatenate

# to know type
type(first_number)
